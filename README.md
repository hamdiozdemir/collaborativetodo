Collaborative To-Do App with Flask

A To-Do App that let you and others work together.

There are mainly two roles: Admin and just regular guys might be from different departments.

While regular guys can add, archive, delete todos for their department, common or todo that is assign for them, admin can do them everybody. Also admin can assign a to-do for someone individually.

As I did my best for my first independent project, still some updates and fixes requires.
I will try to add a admin dashboard soon.
Also that would be better if I can sort todos according their deadlines at index page. I need to handle with JS a bit.
